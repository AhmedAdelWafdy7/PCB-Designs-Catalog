# PCB-Designs-Catalog

Welcome to my GitHub repo where I showcase some of my advanced PCB designs. I have created various projects using FPGA+Soc, stm32, esp and more. You can find the schematics, layouts, BOMs and firmware for each design in the corresponding folders.

I am passionate about PCB design and I love to share my knowledge and experience with others. If you are interested in learning more about my projects or if you need a custom PCB design for your own application, feel free to contact me directly. I am always open to new challenges and opportunities.

You can reach me by email at fandes99@gmail.com or by phone at +201096514812. I look forward to hearing from you and collaborating with you on your next PCB design project.
