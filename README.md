# PCB-Designs-Catalog

Welcome to my GitHub repo where I showcase some of my advanced PCB designs. I have created various projects using FPGA+Soc, stm32, esp and more. You can find the schematics, layouts, BOMs and firmware for each design in the corresponding folders.

One of my most recent and exciting projects is the custom-stm-design, which is a custom PCB board based on the STM32F405x microcontroller. This board is designed to be versatile, powerful, and easy to use. It has the following features:

- Power supply from +12V, using a buck converter to regulate the voltage for the MCU and other components. It also supports USB power and data, allowing you to connect the board to your computer or other devices. You can use the USB interface to program, debug, or communicate with the board.
- UART and I2C interfaces, which are useful for serial communication with sensors, actuators, or other boards. You can use these interfaces to expand the functionality of your board or integrate it with other systems.
- SWD debugging, which is a low-pin-count interface that allows you to access the core features of the MCU. You can use SWD debugging to monitor, control, or modify the behavior of your board in real time.

The custom-stm-design project is a private submodule in this repo. You can access it by following this link: [custom-stm-design](https://github.com/AhmedAdelWafdy7/custom-stm-design/tree/main)

I am passionate about PCB design and I love to share my knowledge and experience with others. If you are interested in learning more about my projects or if you need a custom PCB design for your own application, feel free to contact me directly. I am always open to new challenges and opportunities.
